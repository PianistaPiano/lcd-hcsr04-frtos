# lcd-hcsr04-frtos
HCSR04 + LCD working on FRTOS

This is project where HCSR04 measure distance when user click on button. After click on the button distance is showing on lcd. In the same time dummy data are showing on lcd.
I wrote on my own a library for lcd and hcsr04. You can copy files LCD_H4478U.c and .h (Core/Src, Core/Inc) and make little changes in FRTOS commands. Project is preapred for Nucleo F411RE.
